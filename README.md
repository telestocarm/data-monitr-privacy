Privacy Policy for Data Monitr app

TL;DR
Data Monitr doesn't collect and send any of your data over the network as it doesn't ask for internet permissions. The app runs locally and the data is completely yours and yours alone. 

Data Monitr doesn't run any servers nor it requests for internet permissions. It doesn't serve you any ads. Data Monitr asks for READ_PHONE_STATE as it requires IMSI number of your SIM card to calculate the mobile data used from that particular SIM card. Data Monitr doesn't send this IMSI number to anyone. It will be used locally on your device. Data Monitr also asks for Package Usage Stats permission to calculate the data used for a particular day and live internet speed.
